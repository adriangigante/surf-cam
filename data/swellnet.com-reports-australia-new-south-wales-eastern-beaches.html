Surf: lumpy 2-3ft ENE   <br>Winds: Light and variable SE<br>Weather: partly cloudy<br>Rating: 4/10<br>Good to see a bit more size on the open beaches this morning. The swell has perked back up a little more and conditions are clean on the faces though wobbly with a variable wind and high tide. Best from mid-morning as the tide drops.
